## Introduction

TypeScript has become the standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. Let's explore the best practices that will help you write cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your TypeScript configuration. This catches more errors at compile time and results in more reliable code.

## Type Inference

Let TypeScript infer types when possible. Don't over-annotate your code - TypeScript is smart enough to figure out many types automatically.

## Utility Types

Use built-in utility types like Partial, Required, Pick, and Omit to transform existing types without duplicating code.

## Discriminated Unions

Use discriminated unions for handling different states or variants of an object. This provides excellent type safety and exhaustive checking.

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you write better TypeScript code and avoid common pitfalls.
