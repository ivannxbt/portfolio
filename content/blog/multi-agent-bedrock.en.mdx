## Why multi-agent now?
Enterprise teams rarely trust a single LLM call. Procurement and legal workflows need classifiers, summarizers, and planners operating with audit trails. Bedrock's managed agents plus LangGraph give us that orchestration layer without reinventing the runtime.

## Architecture sketch
1. **Ingress** — S3 event drops a contract, emits metadata to EventBridge.
2. **Planner** — a LangGraph supervisor selects a Bedrock Agent (Claude 3.5) with a policy prompt and structured tool definitions.
3. **Specialists** — each agent executes atomic tools (SageMaker endpoints, SAP APIs, Slack notifications) and returns JSON.
4. **Evaluator** — RAGAS + heuristics grade the outputs and either escalate or publish to DynamoDB.

## Observability concerns
- Emit LangGraph spans to CloudWatch EMF; sampling hides PII but keeps latency percentiles.
- Store every agent step plus tool arguments in DynamoDB with TTL—SOX friendly, low-cost.
- Force evaluations to be multilingual: I run the same rubric in ES and EN to catch translation drift.

## Takeaways
Multi-agent setups succeed when the interface between steps is boring (JSON schemas + typed errors) and when evaluation is automated. Bedrock handles auth and scaling; LangGraph gives me deterministic flows; the rest is disciplined data engineering.
