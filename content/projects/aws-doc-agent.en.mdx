## Scope
Legal and operations teams generated four templates manually: onboarding packs, SLA annexes, ESG addenda, and vendor scorecards. Each document pulled from different APIs, spreadsheets, and knowledge bases.

## Architecture
- LangChain orchestrates tool-aware agents powered by Bedrock Claude.
- Retrieval layer mixes Bedrock Knowledge Bases with S3 semantic stores for contextual grounding.
- Step Functions manages validation, human approvals, and retries, persisting state in DynamoDB and emitting events to EventBridge webhooks.

## Impact
Documents now assemble in under two minutes with structured citations. FinOps dashboards track token usage per template, and guardrails enforce policy prompts before sending PDFs to clients.
