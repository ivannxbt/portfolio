## Pipeline
Images land in S3, trigger Lambda preprocessing, and move through a PyTorch segmentation model. A FastAPI service exposes inference plus explainability overlays consumed by QA operators.

## MLOps
Training pipelines log metrics to ClearML, and a drift monitor alerts when fat distribution changes. Rollouts happen via blue/green Lambda aliases to avoid downtime.

## Business outcome
Buyers receive standardized reports in both Spanish and English, cutting manual review time by several hours per batch and aligning pricing decisions across plants.
