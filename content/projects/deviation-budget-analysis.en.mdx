## Scope
Budget owners juggled multiple CSVs and dashboards, and deviation analysis took hours to reconcile across systems.

## Approach
- Pipeline ingests invoices, card feeds, and forecast data, normalizes the schema, and writes structured CSVs for LangChain consumption.
- An Azure Functions workflow builds a prompt with the normalized tables and calls Azure OpenAI to narrate key deviations.
- The agent packages the narrative into a DOCX, attaches CSV appendices, and uploads the bundle to SharePoint.

## Impact
Users now receive a DOCX report in minutes, complete with deviation explanations and action items for finance stakeholders.
