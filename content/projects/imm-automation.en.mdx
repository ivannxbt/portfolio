## Challenge
Risk analysts ran overnight batches manually, collecting logs from disparate servers and restarting flows when files were missing.

## Solution
- Refactored calculations into containerized Python/Java services.
- Introduced Unix automation plus Airflow scheduling for dependencies.
- Added observability hooks and Slack alerts for each IMM stage.

## Benefit
Execution time dropped, human intervention became optional, and audit teams gained reproducible evidence for regulatory reviews.
