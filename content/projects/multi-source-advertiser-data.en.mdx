## Scope
Advertiser data flowed from CRM, payment gateways, and manual spreadsheets, creating duplicates and mismatched fiscal identifiers across sources.

## Approach
- Built a Python pipeline that normalizes identifiers, cleans punctuation, and matches records through clustering + probabilistic joins.
- Generated quality reports with Excel/CSV exports while LangChain agents validate fiscal IDs and fill missing addresses using Azure OpenAI.
- Stored the cleaned master table in Azure SQL and surfaced alerts through Databricks notebooks.

## Impact
The process delivered a single, auditable view of advertiser data, surfaced anomalies for finance teams, and automated downstream report generation.
