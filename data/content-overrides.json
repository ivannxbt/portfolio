I'm an AI & Software Engineer currently based in Madrid, but I was born and raised in Isla de Margarita, Venezuela (take a look if you'd like [here](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_de_Margarita)).\n\n**Interests**\n\nIn my free time, I like to play some sports, see movies and to be around with my hometown friends. \n\n**Fun facts**\n\nI'm not a enjoyer of old movies, or songs for that matter, but I'm beginning to take a hang of it.\n\nCurrently learning to dance Salsa!\n\nI love reading about history, journalism, politics, economics and things about how our world works.\n\nMy favorite dish is my grandma's lasagna :)",
